## Code

We dream [new possibilities](http://www.scuttlebutt.nz) into being in our spare time. This work brings us strength and foresight in how and what we build.


## Human

We love working with people. We don't just code - we are also skilled teachers, facilitators, and scrum masters.
Our experience across domains makes us excellent guides and interpreters. 

Technology is hard. Communicating clearly and working together to solve problems is harder. We work with you to discover and solve problems in a creative and enjoyable way.


## Process 

We work in dynamic open source spaces and iterative projects. If you're new to this space we would love to develop a process which works best for you and your project.
