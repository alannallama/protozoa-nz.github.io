## Code

We dream [new possibilities](http://www.scuttlebutt.nz) into being in our spare time. This work brings us strength and foresight in how and what we build.


## Human 

We don't just code - we are also skilled teachers, facilitators, and scrum masters.
Our experience across domains makes us excellent guides and interpreters.


## Process 

We work in dynamic open source spaces and iterative projects. If you're new to this space we would love to develop a process which works best for you and your project.
