## Services

### Web Development

We build beautiful applications - from performant client-side interfaces and APIs to cutting edge offline-first solutions.

We guide you through the process of creating successful software. 
Once we understand your business needs, we run iteratively through a cycle of designing, building, and review.
Delivering working software early means faster adaptation, and ultimately a better fitting solution.


### Security Design 

Building systems to be secure from the start is essential.
We architect and review designs for secure web systems. 


### Training

We're experienced in delivering tailored curriculum and workshops that meets the needs of diverse groups.

**Technical**

We can bring your techinical team up to speed in new technologies, teach your seniors how to support juniors, or help establish agile processes.

**Non-technical**

Work more effecitivly by understanding your technical team and the processes and technologies they are using.
We're experts in translating from the technical domain into plain english.

## Code

We dream [new possibilities](http://www.scuttlebutt.nz) into being in our spare time. This work brings us strength and foresight in how and what we build.


## Human

We love working with people. We don't just code - we are also skilled teachers, facilitators, and scrum masters.
Our experience across domains makes us excellent guides and interpreters. 

Technology is hard. Communicating clearly and working together to solve problems is harder. We work with you to discover and solve problems in a creative and enjoyable way.


## Process 

We work in dynamic open source spaces and iterative projects. If you're new to this space we would love to develop a process which works best for you and your project.
